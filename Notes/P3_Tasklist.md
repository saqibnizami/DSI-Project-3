# Project 3
## Stuff I Have To Do:

[x]1. make sure that the scraped info is usable: check the time data
2. get some kind of basic model going with the information that we do have
    - review the nlp lectures
    - main question of the project: What characterisitcs of a post on Reddit are most predicitive of the overall interaction on a thread (as measured by number of comments)
        - possible predictors:
            1. subreddit
            2. domain
            3. image/text/video
            4. time of day
            5. duration of the post
    - logistic regression, 
3. build a classification model using nlp (maybe bag of words for the titles, i.e. are there buzzwords?)
4. the target is the number of comments
5. frame the initial problem as good or bad submission, i.e. a logistic regression based on # comments.
    - good >= median (50th percentile)


[x]overnight script:
concat sub ids
run feature pulls
