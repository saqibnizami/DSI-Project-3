Stuff I Have To Do For the Project:

1. make sure that the scraped info is usable: check the time data
2. get some kind of basic model going with the information that we do have
    - review the nlp lectures
    - main question of the project: What characterisitcs of a post on Reddit are most predicitive of the overall interaction on a thread (as measured by number of comments)
        - possible predictors:
            1. subreddit
            2. domain
            3. image/text/video
            4. time of day
            5. duration of the post
    - logistic regression, 
3. build a classification model using nlp (maybe bag of words for the titles, i.e. are there buzzwords?)
4. the target is the number of comments
